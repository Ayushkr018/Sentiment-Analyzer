# Sentiment-Analyzer
This project uses voice input to detect and classify human emotions using sentiment analysis techniques. By integrating speech recognition with natural language processing, the system analyzes the tone, pitch, and content of spoken language to determine emotional states like happiness, sadness, anger, or neutrality.
